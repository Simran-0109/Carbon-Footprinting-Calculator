üöÄ Features
Indian Household Footprint Calculator: Allows users to calculate their annual CO2 footprint based on:

Electricity Usage (units/year)

LPG Gas Usage (cylinders/year)

Water Usage (liters/day)

Waste Production (kilograms/day)

India-Specific Emission Factors: The calculation script (script.js) uses emission factors tailored for the Indian context (e.g., 0.82 kg CO2 per unit of electricity).

Vehicle Footprint Calculator: Includes a navigation link for a separate vehicle footprint calculator.

Comprehensive Informational Pages: A full suite of static pages to educate users on related environmental topics:

Environmental Impact: What it is, its causes, and effects.

Global Impact: Discusses the worldwide consequences of carbon emissions.

Recycling: A guide on the importance of recycling and how to start.

Renewable Energy: An overview of renewable resources like solar, wind, and hydro.

Eco-Friendly Transport: Information on sustainable transportation options.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
The project is built entirely with front-end technologies:

HTML5: For the structure and content of all pages.

JavaScript: For the core logic of the household carbon footprint calculation.

CSS:

Tailwind CSS: Used for modern, utility-first styling on most pages.

Bootstrap: Used for components (like the navbar and carousel) and styling on several pages.
